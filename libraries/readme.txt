For information on installing libraries, see: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

Sean's notes:
    - to make your own "library" (or header files.. that you will include in your sketches using #include "libraryName.h" ) first, write up the .h and .cpp file for the library, then make a directory inside the libraries/ directory, and then move your .cpp and .h files to that.
